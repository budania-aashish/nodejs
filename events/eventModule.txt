Node.js has a built-in module, called "Events", where you can create-, fire, and listen for- your own events. 

All events properties and methods are an instance of an EventEmitter object. To be able to access these properties and methods, create an EventEmitter object. 

var events = require('events');
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();
